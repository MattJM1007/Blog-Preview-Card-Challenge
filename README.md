## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS 
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I had a much better time with this project than the first one. The challenge is always getting the formating just right and figuring out how to center the main image. I adjusted the main container size and added the padding, which seemed to work. 

I alos learned how to add hover states with CSS.

### Continued development

I want to get more comfortable and faster with laying out a web page and content. 

### Useful resources

- [My Previous Challenge Solution Comments](https://www.frontendmentor.io/solutions/qr-code-component-with-html-css-and-flexbox-kxpTcUQ1i5) - The comments on my last challenge helped me to be more thoughtful and use more specific tags in my html code.

-[Setting Line Height and text spacing](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_text_spacing.asp) - This helped me set the line height in the description to get the spacing right.
